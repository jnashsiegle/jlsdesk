                    <h3>So what do you get when you hire me? </h3>
      
      <p>Overall I am the clay that is warmed and malleable for the right environment.  I am a sponge ready to absorb the knowledge and experience swirling around waiting to be claimed and put to use.  Right here is the one who doesn’t want to settle where I am but wants to reach for the next stage, to learn why things are and do it! Ready to succeed I begin as a woman with experience in working in all types of business environments; from formal business to casual business and adapts to the current atmosphere successfully.  I begin with the skills to play well with others, utilizing diplomacy and teamwork in order to get goals accomplished.  As well there is the willingness to work on the menial tasks in order to prove I am capable of doing more.  The love of a good challenge and variety of responsibilities drives me; deadlines don’t scare me and adrenaline is the best fuel.  If I know the end goal, and clear expectations; I have the initiative to do what I need to accomplish my task.  I will throw everything I have into a project and it’s hard for me to stop until I am done.  I’ll stay up all night working on a segment of Code that is refusing to work well until I find the error or discover the solution for the problem or need.  &lpar;I drink a lot of coffee.&rpar;   Mostly though, what you get is a person with a passion for building web sites/apps that clients will love. </p>       
      <h3>What am I? </h3>
      <p>I am Project Management, I am Team Lead, I am a Team Player, I do handle large important clients, I am a liaison, I do software testing.  One of the biggest things I have gained from my Bachelor’s Program at Full Sail is the fact that Back End development is no longer something to be afraid of.  It’s a horizon I’m striving to learn more about.  I want to experience it.  I want to reach out and grab it by its tail, twirl it around and live it!</p>
      <p>I am a Web Application Developer; it’s nice to meet you.  Where shall we go today?</p>
